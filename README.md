# Electrum Paper Wallet

This app creates a printable Bitcoin paper wallet based on an [Electrum](https://electrum.org) wallet seed.
The wallet is rendered in real time using canvas techniques and can be downloaded as PNG.

It's a simple and modern open source web application based on React and Redux.
The code runs completely on client side and no data will be transferred to any server or third party.
